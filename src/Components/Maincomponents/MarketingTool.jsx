                    against the Net Sales of a Product shall accrue in favor of
                    the Affiliate in the calendar month that the refund/return

                    corresponding Customer, as per the Returns and Refunds
                    Policy, and provided the no Commission Exemptions have
                    occurred against such Product. Commission payments against
                    an Invoice shall be payable by the Company to the Affiliate
                    on or before the 15th day of the calendar month in which

                    that once an Invoice has been issued, the Affiliate cannot
                    request any changes to the contents or form of such Invoice,
                    for any reason whatsoever. If the Affiliate wishes to
                    contest the contents of the Invoice, they may only do so to
                    challenge any perceived discrepancies, under the provisions
                    of Clause 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 hereunder (if applicable).
                    <br /> <br />
                    3.3.2 The Company reserves the right to withhold any
                    Commission payments under an Invoice, where the aggregate
                    Commission due and payable under such Invoice is less than
                    the PKR equivalent of USD 25 (at the prevailing exchange
                    rate). In such event, the Company shall carry over the
                    accrued Commission onto the Invoice for the following
                    calendar month, and pay the same out only once the total
                    Commission due on a subsequent Invoice crosses the PKR
                    equivalent of USD 25 (at the prevailing exchange rate).
                    <br /> <br />
                    3.4 The Company shall specify any deductions made against
                    the Commissions in the corresponding Invoice. The Company
                    shall be entitled to make deductions from the Commissions
                    for the following reasons:
                    <br /> <br />
                    3.4.1 To adjust any erroneous overcalculation of Commissions
                    due in a previous Invoice;
                    <br /> <br />
                    3.4.2 For Commissions paid against a previous Invoice, for a
                    Product against which a Commission Exemption under Clause
                    3.2 (b), (c), (e), or (f) occurred after that corresponding
                    Invoice was issued (or if the Company became aware of such
                    Commission Exemption after the corresponding Invoice was
                    issued);
                    <br /> <br />
                    3.4.3 For any applicable withholding taxes (including VAT if
                    applicable) that the Company is required to withhold as per
                    the law;
                    <br /> <br />
                    3.4.4 For Commissions that are linked to any breach of the
                    Affiliates obligations or representations under this
                    Agreement;
                    <br /> <br />
                    3.4.5 For any processing fees and/or bank charges incurred
                    by Company with respect to the transferring the relevant
                    Commission payments to the Affiliate; and
                    <br /> <br />
                    3.4.6 To set-off any amounts due to the Company from the
                    Affiliate, for any reason whatsoever.
                    <br /> <br />
                    3.5 The Company shall also provide the Affiliate with access
                    to a dashboard on the Channel, which shall allow the
                    Affiliate to view historical data on (a) how many times
                    Customers have visited the Channels by Clicking the
                    Hyperlink; (b) how many orders were placed by the Customers
                    as a result of the Promotion; (c) how much sales revenue was
                    generated to calculate the Net Sales and (d) Customer
                    conversion rates.
                    <br /> <br />
                    3.5.1 The Affiliate may reconcile Invoice against the data
                    on this dashboard, and in the event, the Affiliate finds a
                    discrepancy which potentially indicates an error in the
                    calculation of Commissions on the Invoice, the Affiliate
                    shall be entitled to raise a dispute, by notifying the
                    Company in writing no later then 30 days after that Invoice
                    is issued.
                    <br /> <br />
                    3.5.2 Where the Affiliate raises a dispute under Clause
                    3.5.1, the Company shall conclusively investigate the
                    dispute to determine whether or not there is any merit to
                    the dispute, and if so, the Company shall adjust the
                    Commissions payable in favor of the Affiliate on the
                    following Invoice. In the event, no merit is found that
                    dispute shall be resolved in favor of the Company. The
                    Company’s calculation of Commission due as a result of such
                    investigation shall be final and conclusive for the
                    determination of disputes raised under Clause 3.5.1.
